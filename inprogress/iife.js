/*IIFE -

Immediately Invoked Function Expression is a way to execute functions immediately, as soon as they are created.
This is a good way to protect the scope of your function and the variables within it.*/


(function () {
    // write your js code here
})();

/*Named IIF with Parameters*/
(function showCurrentDate(date) {
    console.log('I m from IIFE', date)
})(new Date());


/*IIF is the most better way to avoid,
‚óè Polluting global variables
‚óè Overwrite global scope.*/


const name = 'üåô';
(function () {
    const name = '‚ú©';
    console.log("Hello " + name);
}());
console.log("Hello " + name);


/*OUTPUT:
    Hello ‚ú©
    Hello üåô*/


// Another use case for an IIFE is, it can be used as a closure
const generateUniqueId = (function () {
    let counter = 0;
    return function () {
        ++counter;
        return `JSN_${counter}`;
    };
})();
console.log(generateUniqueId()); // JSN_1
console.log(generateUniqueId()); // JSN_2
console.log(generateUniqueId()); // JSN_3

/*
The counter variable is inaccessible from outside of the IIFE.
Except for the function that's being returned, nobody can read or modify the counter variable.
Note: In ES6, we can just use curly braces ({}) and use const or let to get the same effect.*/
