POLYMORPHISM

. Polymorphism is one of the principles of
  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

. It is used to share or override any behavior of 
  objects with the specifications provided objects.

. It takes the inheritance as a key to achieving
  this
  
. Javascript is an interpreted language but not a 
  compiled language. So method overloading is not
  posisible
